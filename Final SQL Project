# This is my final SQL Project , I imported a data set called Chinook, which represents a digital media store that includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
# Below I came up with some interesting that questions that I consider to be relevant for this data set

-- 1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS Full_Name, customerId,country
FROM customers
where country <> 'USA';

-- 2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS Full_Name, customerId,country
FROM customers
where country='Brazil';

-- 3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS Full_Name,invoiceID,date(invoicedate) AS InvoiceDate ,BillingCountry
FROM customers c
inner join invoices i
on c.customerid=i.customerid
where country='Brazil';

-- OR 

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
on inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";


-- 4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT * from employees
where title='Sales Support Agent';

-- 5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry from invoices;

-- 6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name


SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

-- 7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.


SELECT emp.FirstName || ' ' || emp.LastName AS Agent_Name, cust.FirstName || ' ' || cust.LastName AS Customer_Name, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

-- OR

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

-- 8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?

select count(*) as Invoice_Number from invoices
where invoicedate like '2009%'

-- OR

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

-- 9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

-- 10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;

-- 11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID

SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;


-- 12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre

SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.Albums a 
on a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types m
on m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.Genres g
on g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

-- 13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

select e.firstname,e.lastname,round(sum(i.total),2) as Invoices_Total from employees e
join customers c
on c.supportRepId=e.employeeId
join invoices i
on i.customerId=c.customerId
where e.title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
group by e.firstname

-- OR

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

-- 14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
